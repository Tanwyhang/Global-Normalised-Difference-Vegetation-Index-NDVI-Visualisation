NDVI is a special way to check how healthy plants are. It uses two types of light: red and near-infrared. By comparing these two kinds of light that bounce off plants, NDVI gives a number. If the number is high, it means the plants are healthy and strong. If it's low, the plants might be sick or not there at all. People use NDVI to watch over plants and see if they need help, like more water or better care.

NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. It's a numerical indicator that quantifies vegetation health and density by measuring the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and red light reflected by vegetation. 

Here's how it's calculated:

$NDVI = \frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)}$

In this formula:
- $NIR$ is the amount of near-infrared light reflected.
- $Red$ p is the amount of red light reflected.

NDVI values typically range from -1 to 1. Higher values (closer to 1) indicate healthier, denser vegetation, while lower values (closer to -1) indicate sparse or stressed vegetation. Values around zero often represent non-vegetated surfaces, like water or urban areas.

NDVI is widely used in agriculture, forestry, ecology, and climate studies. It helps monitor changes in vegetation over time, assess crop health, estimate biomass, and identify areas affected by factors like drought, deforestation, or desertification.
