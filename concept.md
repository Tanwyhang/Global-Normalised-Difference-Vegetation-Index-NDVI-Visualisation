Sure! Here's a plain text summary of what we were doing in the program:

1. **Tools We Need**: 
   - Geopandas: Helps us work with maps
   - Shapely: Helps us draw shapes like points and circles
   - Fiona: Helps us read and write map files
   - Pyproj: Helps us change coordinates
   - Rasterio: Helps us work with pictures of maps
   - Matplotlib: Helps us make pictures of our maps
   - Folium: Helps us make interactive maps we can click on

2. **Steps to Follow**:
   - Read a Map File: Use Geopandas to load a map file.
   - Draw Shapes: Use Shapely to create geometric shapes like points.
   - Change Coordinates: Use Pyproj to transform coordinates between different projections.
   - Read a Picture of a Map: Use Rasterio to read raster map files.
   - Make a Simple Map Picture: Use Matplotlib to visualize the map data.
   - Make an Interactive Map: Use Folium to create an interactive map.

3. **Putting It All Together**:
   - Load a Map File: Load a shapefile using Geopandas.
   - Draw a Circle Around a Point: Use Shapely to create a point and buffer it to create a circle.
   - Show the Map and Circle: Use Matplotlib to plot the map data and the buffered circle.

4. **Summary**:
   - We use Python tools to make maps.
   - These tools help us read maps, draw shapes, change coordinates, and create visualizations.
   - By combining these steps, we can build our own GIS program.
